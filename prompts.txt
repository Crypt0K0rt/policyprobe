  Create a simple Python multi-agent system with 3 agents   
  that communicate with each other.                         
  Include:                                                  
  1. A coordinator agent that dispatches tasks to worker    
  agents                                                    
  2. Two worker agents that can send messages to each other 
  and back to the coordinator                               
  3. Use simple function calls or HTTP requests between     
  agents                                                    
  4. Don't worry about security or authentication - just    
  make it functional                                        
  5. Include examples of agents calling each other directly


  Put it all in a single file called agent_system.py under the backend/agents folder
